  <h4>General Rules</h4>
  <p>
    Use your common sense: don't hack into the game servers, don't deliberately
    corrupt or leak memory or otherwise try to crash or hang up the game, don't
    abuse the RNG, and don't be a jerk.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bots are prohibited as well. TNNT is a tournament for human players, not a
    competition for the best or luckiest bot. Players found to be running a bot
    may be summarily banned from the tournament. (Our working definition of a
    bot is any system that automatically evaluates game state. Thus, pasting
    macros is fine, but running a startscum script that quits the game if your
    inventory, stats, or surroundings do not meet certain criteria is not.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Apart from bots, anything within the normal execution of the game is fair
    game. This includes farming, scumming, abusing program bugs, reading other
    characters' dumplogs, viewing ttyrecs of your own or others' games, using
    interface enhancers like InterHack, and hanging out on IRC to see if the
    gray stone you picked up in Mines' End gets livelogged as the luckstone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Digging for victory is fine, of course, but please make sure to set !bones
    in your rc file so that you don't leave useless bones and throw away other
    players' interesting bones on your way down.
  </p>

  <h4>Clans</h4>
  <p>
    To create clans, invite players to your clan, and accept invitations to
    others' clans,
    {% if not user.is_authenticated %}
      please <a href="/login">log in</a>.
    {% else %}
      go <a href="/clanmgmt">here</a>.
    {% endif %}
  </p>
  <p>
    Clan size is capped at 12, and a clan is not allowed to have more than 12
    pending invitations. The tournament is designed so that adding new clan
    members, however inexperienced, cannot hurt the clan overall.
  </p>
  <p>
    At November 10th at midnight UTC, clan membership will become frozen;
    people can still leave or be kicked out of clans, but cannot create new
    clans or join new clans.
  </p>

  <h4>Trophies</h4>
  <p>
    Various accomplishments across one or multiple games earn you trophies. To
    see how to earn these, go to the <a href="/trophies">Trophies page</a>
    <!-- 2021 TODO: revisit this when trophies are in their final form -->
    and hover over them; they will show up as a tooltip. Some trophies need a
    bit more explanation and are covered below.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many of the trophies which can be earned individually can also be earned
    collectively by a clan. If an individual earns one of these trophies on
    their own, their clan will also get the trophy.
  </p>

  <h5>The Great and Lesser Race/Role</h5>
  <p>
    The Great Race/Role are a set of multi-ascension trophies for playing all of
    the interesting character combinations for a given race or role. Gender does
    not matter. Alignment does not matter for The Great Race, but it does for
    The Great Role.  Only starting alignment is counted - tricks with changing
    your alignment in-game won't work.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Great Human is a special case, and requires you to play only those roles
    which must be human, as shown in the table below.  The required Monk can be
    of any alignment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, there is no such thing as the Great Knight, Samurai, or Tourist,
    because only a single race and alignment combination can be played with
    these roles.
  </p>
  <p>
    These may be achieved by individual players or by clans working together.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below is a table of requirements for each race or role:
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr class="framed">
          <th>Trophy</th>
          <th>Number of Ascensions</th>

          <td>5</td>
          <td>Hum-N, Hum-C, Elf-C, Gno-N, Orc-C</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Lesser Race/Role works identically to the Great, but instead of ascending,
    you must instead complete a game with each required character combination
    where you successfully retrieve the luckstone from the bottom of the Mines
    <strong>AND</strong> retrieve the prize from the end of Sokoban.
  </p>

  <p>
    Like other trophies, these can also be earned collectively by a clan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Achieving a Great Race or Role does not necessarily imply that you also
    deserve the same Lesser Race or Role, since it is possible to ascend
    without completing Sokoban and/or retrieving the Mines' End luckstone.
  </p>

  <h5>Ascending without Killing (insert monster here)</h5>
  <p>
    These trophies are fairly straightforward for the most part, but one bit of
    clarification: in order to achieve the trophy, you can't let the specified
    monster die by any means, like how it works in Junethack. Merely abstaining
    from killing them personally while your pets or conflicted monsters finish
    them off will not earn the trophy.
  </p>

  <h4>Streaking</h4>
  <p>
    A streak is a series of consecutive winning games by the same player.
    Because you can have multiple in-progress games on multiple servers, the
    rule is that the first game started after a win is the candidate for
    continuing a streak. Winning or losing non-candidate games will not affect
    the streak whatsoever.
  </p>
  <p>
    For those familiar with DCSS tournaments, these rules are the same as theirs.
  </p>

  <h4>Achievements</h4>
  <p>
    Achievements are small in-game accomplishments you can collect for yourself
    and your clan, which vary in difficulty from pretty easy to very
    challenging. You can use the #achievements command during a game to view
    which ones are and aren't completed. The #tnntstats command is also useful
    for viewing progress towards certain achievements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Navigate to your clan or player page to see a list of all achievements and
    what is required to earn them.
