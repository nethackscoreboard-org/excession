  <h4>History</h4>
  <p>
    The long-running
    <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki//dev/null/nethack_tournament" target="_blank">
      /dev/null/nethack tournament
    </a>
    was unexpectedly shut down in September 2017. When this was announced, some
    players from TeamSplat banded together quickly with the help of the
    hardfought.org server to put together a tribute tournament, which was
    intended to be the same as devnull but updated to 3.6.0.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tribute tournament was never planned to run for a second year;
    instead, respecting devnull's wishes to shut down completely and not keep
    its name going, plans for a new tournament were laid. This new tournament
    would be based off the newly available development version of NetHack, and
    would remain a primarily vanilla-like tournament, unlike other tournaments
    like <a href="https://junethack.net" target="_blank">Junethack</a> which
    focus on variant play.  It was also decided to keep the tradition of running
    the tournament throughout November, when a lot of veteran players come out
    of the woodwork checking to see if there's a tournament.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the 2021 tournament, the TNNT website (not the game itself) was
    reimplemented from the ground up, primarily to get it written in Python
    instead of Perl, for maintainability reasons. This year also saw a big
    change to scoring &mdash; players and clans are no longer assigned points
    for each kind of accomplishment, and instead of only showing the top player
    in various game metrics, a series of leaderboards show all players and clans
    competing in them.
  </p>

  <h4>So TNNT is devnull?</h4>
  <p>
    TNNT is <i>not</i> devnull. As per krystal's wishes, the devnull name,
    tournament structure, and game changes have been retired. TNNT is a fresh
    start - any game changes are based on a clean vanilla nethack codebase, and
    the various components of the tournament were designed from scratch.
  </p>

  <h4>What about the devnull challenges?</h4>
  <p>
    As with the rest of devnull, the challenges have been permanently retired
    and are not implemented in TNNT. However, TNNT does add some of its own
    gameplay content, including features that don't exist in any variants. It's
    a bit of a work in progress. We may keep adding a bit of new content every
    year.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are looking for the code powering the devnull tribute challenges,
    to use as a patch for your own purposes, you can find the devnull tribute
    scoreboard repo
    <a href="https://github.com/borekl/devnull-tribute-2017" target="_blank">here</a>,
    and the devnull tribute game code
    <a href="https://github.com/NHTangles/NetHack36/tree/devnull_hdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
  </p>

  <h4>What's the new content in TNNT?</h4>
  <p>
    To not spoil players that are new to TNNT, the additional content that
    has been added to the game has been purposely omitted from this site.
    For those that wish to learn about all of the new game content in TNNT,
    please visit the TNNT entry on the
    <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/The_November_NetHack_Tournament" target="_blank">
